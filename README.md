This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript due to its dynamic typing.  The function `foo` intends to add two numbers, but when a number and a string are passed, JavaScript performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition. This can lead to unexpected results and logic errors in your code.

The solution shows how to explicitly check the data types to avoid this issue.
